üåü IoT-Based Multiple Hazards Detection System üö® A smart system using sensors (MQ135, PIR, IR, Inductive, DHT11), GPS, LoRa, and ThingSpeak to detect fire, gas, motion, metals, and environment conditions in real-time. Built during my internship at Siemens CoE to enhance safety &amp; emergency response.


Introducing our revolutionary project: the IoT-based Multiple Hazards Detection System! In an era where safety is paramount, our innovative system utilizes IoT technology to detect various hazards in real-time, providing proactive measures to mitigate risks and ensure the safety of lives and property.

üîç Sensor Insights:
- Air Quality Monitoring (MQ135): Detects harmful gases like carbon monoxide, ammonia, benzene, and alcohol vapor, ensuring air safety.
- Motion Detection (PIR sensor): Enables early detection of motion in combat regions.
- Flame Detection (IR Sensors): Senses fire in its path, facilitating prompt response to potential fire hazards.
- Metal Detection (Inductive Proximity Sensor): Detects metals in combat regions, aiding in the identification of threats like landmines.
- Environmental Parameters (DHT11): Captures temperature and humidity data for comprehensive environmental monitoring.

‚öôÔ∏è System Features:
- GPS Module: Provides precise geolocation data, facilitating rapid response and evacuation procedures during emergencies.
- Long Range (LoRa) Communication: Ensures reliable connectivity for timely alerts and coordination, even in remote or challenging environments.
- Data Visualization & Analytics (ThingSpeak): Empowers users with real-time insights into environmental conditions, trends, and anomalies, facilitating informed decision-making.

üí° Impact & Future Scope:
Our Multiple Hazards Detection System represents a significant advancement in safety and security technology. By adding Li-ion batteries, seismic activities, camera, etc we could enhance it.
